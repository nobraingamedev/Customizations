- Download the `.obsidian` folder from ðŸ‘‰ [Here](https://github.com/nobraingamedev/Customizations/raw/main/Obsidian/.obsidian.rar) ðŸ‘ˆ
- Unzip the file
- Paste the `.obsidian` folder in the Vault's folder of Obsidian

The Zip folder contains the Extensions and Setting Tweaks I prefer. This can be but not meant, for Others.
